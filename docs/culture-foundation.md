# Section 1: Culture foundation - cultivating a quality culture

The quality-oriented culture is foundation of a successful QA architecture. It
is essential to establish a mindset that values quality, and creating processes
that support this mindset. Build a strong foundation based on shared
responsibility, open communication and a commitment to quality at all stages of
development. This section will guide you through the key steps to cultivate a
culture of quality in your organization.

## 1.1 From "QA phase" to "Quality all the way"

In many organizations, quality assurance is often seen as a separate phase of
the development process, at the end of the cycle. This approach introduces risk
of overlooking quality issues all the way to the final stages, which can lead to
costly reworks, bottlenecks, fixes, frustrated teams and not satisfied
customers. To avoid these pitfalls, it is crucial to shift the focus from the
“QA phase” to the “Quality all the way”.

### 1.1.1 To achieve this, consider the following

- **Quality is everyone's responsibility**: All team members (developers,
  testers, QA, product managers, designers, etc.) should be responsible for
  product quality. Encourage shared responsibility for quality across the
  organization. Quality should not be the sole responsibility of QAs; it is a
  shared effort that involves all team members. After all, everyone wants to
  deliver a quality product.
- **Quality is not just a checklist**: Quality is not just about meeting
  requirements or passing tests. It's about delivering value to end users. Focus
  on the end-user experience and make sure the product meets their needs and
  expectations. Quality should be the mindset that drives every decision and
  action, from requirements planning to feature delivery and beyond.
- **Quality should be built-in**: Instead of treating quality lightly, build it
  into the development process from the beginning. Implement practices such as
  code reviews, pair programming, continuous integration and automated testing
  to catch problems early and prevent defects from getting into production. By
  integrating quality into every stage of the development cycle, you can ensure
  that the product is of high quality, and you can grow confidence that you
  minimize the risk of defects and rework later on.

### 1.1.2 Practical steps

- **Break down conventional silos** and encourage cross-functional collaboration
  and communication between teams.
- **Integrate QA practices early** in the development process to catch problems
  faster and reduce costs (yes, quality is also cost-effective).
- **Implement a culture of continuous improvement** by collecting feedback,
  analyzing data and learning from mistakes.

## 1.2 From "Blame" to "Feedback"

In a blame culture, mistakes are often hidden, ignored or attributed to
individuals, which can lead to a lack of transparency, trust issues and fear of
failure when trying new, better things. To foster a quality-oriented culture, it
is necessary to move from a blame culture to a feedback culture. Open and honest
feedback is the key to identifying problems, improving processes and supporting
a culture of learning and development. Create an environment where feedback is
welcomed, constructive and used to drive change.

### 1.2.1 To achieve this, consider the following

- **Constructive feedback** should be given in constructive and respectful
  manner. Feedback should focus on behaviors, processes and results, not on
  individuals. Create a safe space where team members feel comfortable sharing
  their thoughts and ideas without fear of retaliation.
- **Use feedback that can be used**, it should be specific, actionable and
  focused on improvement. Avoid vague or general feedback that doesn't provide
  clear guidance on how to address an issue. When providing feedback, offer
  suggestions for improvement and work together to find solutions.
- **Feedback loops** are key to successful feedback. Establish mechanisms for
  collecting feedback from team members, stakeholders and customers. Use
  surveys, retrospectives, one-on-one meetings and other tools to gather
  feedback and identify areas for improvement. Regularly analyze feedback and
  act on it for continuous improvement.

### 1.2.2 Practical steps

- **Establish clear communication channels and expectations**
  - Create specific ways for feedback to be given (regular meetings, online
    tools, dedicated time slots).
  - Clearly communicate what kind of feedback is most valuable (actionable,
    specific, focused on improvement).
- **Foster a culture of psychological safety**
  - Emphasize that feedback is about collective growth, not blame.
  - Encourage asking questions, admitting mistakes, and seeking help as positive
    behaviors.
  - Leaders should model this by openly receiving and giving good feedback
    themselves.
- **Close the feedback loop**
  - Don't let feedback disappear. Have mechanisms to track, discuss, and act on
    it.
  - Share outcomes with the team, so people see their input is valued and leads
    to change.

## 1.3 From "Testing" to "Quality Engineering"

To build a culture of quality, teams need to be equipped with the right
resources and knowledge to consistently deliver quality products. This requires
moving away from traditional “testing” to a more holistic approach. Quality
engineering is a strategic and comprehensive approach to quality that focuses on
prevention, early detection and continuous improvement. It encompasses a wide
range of practices, tools and techniques to ensure that quality is built into
every stage of the development process. We'll talk more about this later in the
manual, just remember that it's not just about testing; it's about investing
(time and effort) in quality from the very beginning.

## 1.4 From "Chaos" to "Metrics-driven"

In a chaotic environment, decisions are made based on hunches, opinions or the
loudest voice in the room. This can lead to inconsistent results, misplaced
priorities and wasted efforts. To create a quality-oriented culture, it is
necessary to move from chaotic, to a metrics-based approach. By using data,
metrics and insights to make decisions, you can make informed choices, measure
progress and identify areas for improvement. Set clear goals, define key
performance indicators (KPIs) and track metrics to monitor the health of
processes and products.

### 1.4.1 To achieve this, consider the following

- **Define clear goals**: Establish specific, measurable, achievable, relevant,
  and time-bound (SMART) goals for your team and projects. Ensure that everyone
  understands the objectives and how they contribute to the overall success of
  the organization.
- **Identify key performance indicators (KPIs)**: Define metrics that align with
  your goals and measure the performance of your processes and products. Choose
  KPIs that are relevant, actionable, and indicative of success. Track these
  metrics regularly and use them to guide decision-making.
- **Leverage data and insights**: Collect data from various sources, such as
  testing tools, monitoring systems, user feedback, and surveys. Analyze this
  data to gain insights into the health of your products and processes. Use
  data-driven insights to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.
- **Iterate and improve**: Use metrics to identify areas for improvement and
  iterate on your processes. Continuously monitor your KPIs, analyze the
  results, and adjust your strategies based on the data. By using a
  metrics-driven approach, you can make data-informed decisions and drive
  continuous improvement.
- **Celebrate successes and learn from failures**: Recognize and celebrate
  achievements when you meet your goals. Use failures as learning opportunities
  to identify areas for improvement and prevent similar issues in the future.
  Encourage a culture of experimentation, learning, and growth.
- **Share insights and learnings**: Communicate your findings, insights, and
  learnings with your team and stakeholders. Share success stories, best
  practices, and lessons learned to foster a culture of transparency,
  collaboration, and continuous improvement.
- **Empower teams with data**: Provide teams with access to relevant data,
  metrics, and insights to make informed decisions. Encourage data-driven
  discussions, experiments, and initiatives to drive improvements and
  innovation.
- **Focus on user-centric metrics**: Measure success not only by internal
  metrics but also by user-centric metrics. Monitor user satisfaction,
  engagement, retention, and other key indicators to ensure that your products
  meet the needs and expectations of your users.

### 1.4.2 Examples of metrics

- **Defect density**: The number of defects found in a specific period or
  project.
- **Test coverage**: The percentage of code covered by automated tests.
- **Code churn**: The rate of change in code over time.
- **Code complexity**: The complexity of the codebase, measured by cyclomatic
  complexity or other metrics.
- **Performance metrics**: Response time, throughput, error rates and so on.
- **User-centric metrics**: User satisfaction, Net Promoter Score (NPS),
  retention rate, and other user-focused indicators.
