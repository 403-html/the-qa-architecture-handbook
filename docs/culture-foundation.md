# Section 1: Culture foundation - cultivating a quality culture

The foundation of a quality-first culture is the cornerstone of a successful QA
architecture. It is essential to establish a mindset that values quality and to
create processes that support this mindset. Build a strong foundation based on
shared responsibility, open communication, and commitment to quality on all
stages of development. This section will guide you through the key steps to
cultivate a quality culture in your organization.

## 1.1 From "QA phase" to "Quality all the way"

By many organizations, quality assurance is often seen as a separate phase in
the development process, at the end of the cycle. This approach introduces a
risk of overlooking quality issues until the final stages, which can lead to
costly reworks, bottlenecks, fixes, frustrated teams, and unhappy customers. To
avoid these pitfalls, it is crucial to shift the focus from "QA phase" to
"Quality all the way".

### 1.1.1 To achieve this, consider the following

- **Quality is everyone's responsibility**: All team members (developers,
  testers, product managers, designers, etc.) should be accountable for the
  quality of the product. Encourage a shared responsibility for quality across
  the organization. Quality should not be the sole responsibility of the QAs; it
  is a collective effort that involves all team members. After all, everyone
  wants to deliver a high-quality product.
- **Quality is not just a checklist**: Quality is not just about meeting the
  requirements or passing the tests. It is about delivering value to the
  end-users. Focus on the end-user experience and ensure that the product meets
  their needs and expectations. Quality should be a mindset that drives every
  decision and action, from planning requirements to delivering features and
  beyond.
- **Quality should be built-in**: Instead of treating quality as an
  afterthought, build it into the development process from the beginning.
  Implement practices like code reviews, pair programming, continuous
  integration, and automated testing to catch issues early and prevent defects
  from reaching production. By embedding quality into every step of the
  development lifecycle, you can ensure that the product is of high quality, and
  minimize the risk of defects and reworks later on.

### 1.1.2 Practical steps

- **Break down conventional silos** and encourage cross-functional collaboration
  and communication between teams.
- **Integrate QA practices early** in the development process to catch issues
  sooner and reduce costs (yes, quality is also cost-effective).
- **Implement a culture of continuous improvement** by collecting feedback,
  analyzing data, and learning from mistakes.

## 1.2 From "Blame" to "Feedback"

In a blame culture, mistakes are often hidden, ignored, or attributed to
individuals, which can lead to a lack of transparency, trust issues, and a fear
of failure. To foster a quality-first culture, it is essential to shift from a
blame culture to a feedback culture. Open and honest feedback is crucial for
identifying issues, improving processes, and fostering a culture of learning and
growth. Create an environment where feedback is welcomed, constructive, and used
to drive change.

### 1.2.1 To achieve this, consider the following

- **Constructive feedback**: Encourage team members to provide feedback in a
  constructive and respectful manner. Feedback should focus on behaviors,
  processes, and outcomes, rather than individuals. Create a safe space where
  team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas without fear of
  retribution.
- **Actionable feedback**: Feedback should be specific, actionable, and focused
  on improvement. Avoid vague or general feedback that does not provide clear
  guidance on how to address the issue. When providing feedback, offer
  suggestions for improvement and collaborate on finding solutions.
- **Feedback loops**: Establish feedback mechanisms to gather input from team
  members, stakeholders, and customers. Use surveys, retrospectives, one-on-one
  meetings, and other tools to collect feedback and identify areas for
  improvement. Regularly review and act on feedback to drive continuous
  improvement.

### 1.2.2 Practical steps

- **Establish clear communication channels and expectations**
  - Create specific ways for feedback to be given (regular meetings, online
    tools, dedicated time slots).
  - Clearly communicate what kind of feedback is most valuable (actionable,
    specific, focused on improvement).
- **Foster a culture of psychological safety**
  - Emphasize that feedback is about collective growth, not blame.
  - Encourage asking questions, admitting mistakes, and seeking help as positive
    behaviors.
  - Leaders should model this by openly receiving and giving good feedback
    themselves.
- **Close the feedback loop**
  - Don't let feedback disappear. Have mechanisms to track, discuss, and act on
    it.
  - Share outcomes with the team, so people see their input is valued and leads
    to change.

## 1.3 From "Testing" to "Quality Engineering"

To build a quality culture, you need to equip teams with the right resources,
and knowledge to deliver high-quality products consistently. This requires a
shift from traditional "testing" to a more holistic approach. Quality
Engineering is a strategic and comprehensive approach to quality that focuses on
prevention, early detection, and continuous improvement. It encompasses a wide
range of practices, tools, and techniques to ensure that quality is built into
every stage of the development process. About it later in the handbook, just
remember that it's not just about testing; it's about investing in quality from
the start.

## 1.4 From "Chaos" to "Metrics-driven"

In a chaotic environment, decisions are made based on gut feelings, opinions, or
the loudest voice in the room. This can lead to inconsistent results, misaligned
priorities, and wasted efforts. To create a quality-first culture, it is
essential to shift from chaos to a metrics-driven approach. By using data,
metrics, and insights to drive decisions, you can make informed choices, measure
progress, and identify areas for improvement. Establish clear goals, define key
performance indicators (KPIs), and track metrics to monitor the health of your
processes and products.

### 1.4.1 To achieve this, consider the following

- **Define clear goals**: Establish specific, measurable, achievable, relevant,
  and time-bound (SMART) goals for your team and projects. Ensure that everyone
  understands the objectives and how they contribute to the overall success of
  the organization.
- **Identify key performance indicators (KPIs)**: Define metrics that align with
  your goals and measure the performance of your processes and products. Choose
  KPIs that are relevant, actionable, and indicative of success. Track these
  metrics regularly and use them to guide decision-making.
- **Leverage data and insights**: Collect data from various sources, such as
  testing tools, monitoring systems, user feedback, and surveys. Analyze this
  data to gain insights into the health of your products and processes. Use
  data-driven insights to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.
- **Iterate and improve**: Use metrics to identify areas for improvement and
  iterate on your processes. Continuously monitor your KPIs, analyze the
  results, and adjust your strategies based on the data. By using a
  metrics-driven approach, you can make data-informed decisions and drive
  continuous improvement.
- **Celebrate successes and learn from failures**: Recognize and celebrate
  achievements when you meet your goals. Use failures as learning opportunities
  to identify areas for improvement and prevent similar issues in the future.
  Encourage a culture of experimentation, learning, and growth.
- **Share insights and learnings**: Communicate your findings, insights, and
  learnings with your team and stakeholders. Share success stories, best
  practices, and lessons learned to foster a culture of transparency,
  collaboration, and continuous improvement.
- **Empower teams with data**: Provide teams with access to relevant data,
  metrics, and insights to make informed decisions. Encourage data-driven
  discussions, experiments, and initiatives to drive improvements and
  innovation.
- **Focus on user-centric metrics**: Measure success not only by internal
  metrics but also by user-centric metrics. Monitor user satisfaction,
  engagement, retention, and other key indicators to ensure that your products
  meet the needs and expectations of your users.

### 1.4.2 Examples of metrics

- **Defect density**: The number of defects found in a specific period or
  project.
- **Test coverage**: The percentage of code covered by automated tests.
- **Code churn**: The rate of change in code over time.
- **Code complexity**: The complexity of the codebase, measured by cyclomatic
  complexity or other metrics.
- **Performance metrics**: Response time, throughput, error rates and so on.
- **User-centric metrics**: User satisfaction, Net Promoter Score (NPS),
  retention rate, and other user-focused indicators.
