## 3.2 Types of automations

Automations can be broadly categorized into two main types: process automations and test automations. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring the efficiency, reliability, and quality of the software development process.

### 3.2.1 Process automations

Process automations focus on streamlining and optimizing the development process by automating repetitive tasks and workflows. These automations help teams save time, reduce errors, and improve efficiency by eliminating manual intervention in routine tasks. Key examples of process automations include:

- **Continuous integration (CI)**: Automating the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository, running automated tests, and providing immediate feedback to developers.
- **Continuous deployment (CD)**: Automating the deployment of code changes to production or staging environments, ensuring that new features are released quickly and reliably.
- **Release management**: Automating the process of managing and coordinating software releases, including versioning, tagging, and deployment.
- **Infrastructure as code (IaC)**: Automating the provisioning and management of infrastructure resources using code, enabling teams to deploy and scale applications more efficiently.
- **Monitoring and alerting**: Automating the monitoring of applications and infrastructure, detecting issues, and alerting teams to potential problems before they impact users.
- **Security scanning**: Automating security scans and vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate security issues in the codebase.
- **Documentation generation**: Automating the generation of documentation, such as API documentation, user guides, and release notes, to ensure that information is up-to-date and consistent.
- **Environment setup and teardown**: Automating the setup and teardown of testing environments, enabling teams to quickly provision and deprovision resources as needed.
- **Task automation**: Automating routine tasks, such as code reviews, issue triaging, and test case generation, to improve productivity and reduce manual effort.

### 3.2.2 Test automations

Test automations focus on automating the testing process to ensure that software meets the desired quality standards. Automated tests can cover a wide range of scenarios, from unit tests that validate individual components to end-to-end tests that verify the functionality of the entire system. Key examples of test automations include:

- **Unit tests**: Automated tests that validate the behavior of individual components or modules in isolation.
- **Integration tests**: Automated tests that verify the interactions between different components or services in the system.
- **API tests**: Automated tests that validate the functionality and performance of APIs, including RESTful APIs, GraphQL endpoints, and web services.
- **Performance tests**: Automated tests that assess the performance and scalability of the application under various load conditions.
- **Security tests**: Automated tests that identify security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and authentication issues.
- **Accessibility tests**: Automated tests that evaluate the accessibility of the application for users with disabilities, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards.
- **End-to-end tests**: Automated tests that simulate user interactions with the application, covering multiple components and workflows to validate the end-to-end functionality.

#### 3.2.2.1 Choosing the right test automation strategy

When implementing test automations, it is essential to choose the right strategy that aligns with your goals, resources, and constraints. Some common test automation strategies include:

- **Test pyramid**: A testing strategy that emphasizes a broad base of unit tests, followed by a smaller number of integration tests, and an even smaller number of end-to-end tests. This approach focuses on testing at different levels of the application to achieve a balance between coverage and speed.
- **Trophy model**: A testing strategy that prioritizes high-value test cases that provide the most business value or cover critical functionality. This approach focuses on identifying and automating key scenarios that are essential for the success of the application. Usually, it's focusing mostly on integration and unit tests, keeping end-to-end tests to cover the most critical paths only.
- **Ice cream cone model**: A testing strategy that emphasizes a large number of end-to-end tests, followed by a smaller number of integration tests, and an even smaller number of unit tests. This approach focuses on validating the end-to-end functionality of the application, with fewer tests at lower levels. It's a valid strategy for MVPs where we need to ensure the critical paths are working as expected, but it should not be the long-term strategy.

### 3.2.3 Choosing the right tools

Selecting the right tools for automations might seem like a daunting task, given the wide range of options available in the market. When choosing tools for process and test automations, consider the following factors:

- **Compatibility**: Ensure that the tools are compatible with your existing technology stack, development environment, and infrastructure. The more people can use them, the better.
